# Challenge

1. Carrying on from the portfolio code, add a link for each project (it doesn't need to go anywhere) and use props to pass it through to the Project functional component.

2. Store the projects in an array. Iterate through the array to display each project.

# Beast Mode

- Implement your own portfolio - projects you have worked on, places you have worked, links to your social pages etc. Make sure you break up each chunk of UI into its own functional component.

- Implement a `public` attribute for the Project component. This should use conditional logic to determine whether the function returns the project or null.
